# Kata: Functional Programming Basics

### What does this kata teach?

* Refactor idiomatic imperative code into idiomatic functional code
* Using Tuples and Lists
* Using Lambdas and Functions
* Refactor to remove mutability by introducing pipeline
* Refactor to replace if/else with match
* Unify data by introducing Option type
* Basic Functional TDD techniques and tool set

### How to use this kata?

0. Speed read the references below (OK to understand very little to start with, emphasis is on building finger memory)
1. Clone repo
2. Checkout Step 0
3. Refer changes in each step, make the same changes on your own, commit
4. Repeat steps 2 to 4 above, until you have built finger memory for the changes

NOTE: Fully understanding the theory is not required to start with. Emphasis is on building finger memory.

### Steps

* Step 0. README & basic plumbing
* Step 1. 1 returns "1" and 2 returns "2"
* Step 2. Use [Theory] to become DRY
* Step 3. 3 returns "Fizz"
* Step 4. 5 returns "Buzz"
* Step 5. 6 returns "Fizz" and 10 returns "Buzz"
* Step 6. 15 returns "FizzBuzz"
* Step 7. 225 returns "FizzBuzz"
* Step 8. Refactor to make DRY using for/tuples/list
* Step 9. Refactor to remove mutability by introducing pipeline
* Step 10. Refactor to extract lambda into a function
* Step 11. Refactor to replace if/else with match
* Step 12. Refactor to unify semantics by using Option type
